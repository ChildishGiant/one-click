<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is this and why should I use it?:</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This is a complete redesign of the traditional password generator/storage system. Instead of relying on a hard drive to not to fail, or that backup you keep forgetting to make, Perdola makes a password based on your master password and the application you want a password for. This generated password will be the same every time, no matter what device you&#39;re on. You can then copy this and paste it into the app you want to log into.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I know you&#39;re not looking at my passwords?:</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> When you hit submit, your computer takes the app name and your master password and using them makes a new password. Nothing is ever sent across the internet, other than the code for the website itself. If you really want, you can <a href="https://github.com/SolarPolarMan/perdola">download the files</a> for the website, smash your router and run Perdola offline (Not that I&#39;d recommend smashing your router.)</p>
<p>If you want to be sure I&#39;m not phishing for passwords or anything like that, you can read through all the <a href="https://github.com/SolarPolarMan/perdola">code on github</a>.</p>
